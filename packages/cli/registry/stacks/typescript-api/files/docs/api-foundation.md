# API foundation

## Lint and boundaries

Generate configuration for the installed Biome release. Enforce cognitive complexity at most 15, at most four parameters, no nested ternaries, no non-null assertions, floating or misused promises, and exhaustive switches. Split complex functions into named steps; never suppress a rule to pass. Check undeclared dependencies in application source against each owning package. The shipped boundary test probes real files: stdin does not expose plugin diagnostics. Keep every probe enabled, with one diagnostic per violation and allowed cases beside them.

Only platform entries import runtime modules or use process globals. Application code takes time and randomness from Effect Clock and Random; only edges run Effects. Yield, return or compose every Effect instead of dropping it. Handlers return declared values or tagged errors, keeping response construction at the HTTP boundary.

## Test infrastructure

Generate one server-target matrix in tests/helpers/targets.ts: write each HTTP contract test once and run it against both a real Node listener on an ephemeral port and the platform-free web handler. Expose a request function and captured structured records for each. Disable framework request logging on both so the request boundary logs once. Dispose both targets after every test, including failed startup.

A testServer helper owns its scope and registers cleanup when the test ends; tempDir creates real temporary files and removes them on completion. An expectEnvelope helper checks the table's status, JSON content type and the body decoded with the envelope schema. Derive helper types from the app and contract rather than copying their shapes. Build these helpers against the installed Effect APIs; do not copy version-sensitive implementations.

Set coverage floors to 90 percent for statements and lines, and 80 percent for branches and functions, and enforce them in the coverage command. Run all shipped harness tests on Node alongside application tests. Include tests/**/*.ts in the tooling typecheck, separating application tests when their module resolution differs.

## Development records

Wire logs to scripts/logs.ts and dev:status to scripts/dev-bg.ts status in the generated package scripts. Query status before starting more servers. Use logs --level warn --since 10m, --request <id>, --path <prefix>, --grep <text>, --tail <n>, --prev or --json to inspect failures. The wrapper records non-API output in logs/dev.jsonl, terminal output in logs/dev.log, and the API writes logs/server.jsonl through LOG_FILE. API terminal records are not duplicated. Each start preserves *.prev.*; an active file past 10 MiB rotates to *.old.*. The API's development file sink must enforce the same cap without replacing *.prev.*. A stopped server's signal-exit note is informational, not an application error. Production logs remain JSON on stdout.

SessionStart reuses the status report and stays quiet when it fails; dev:status exposes failures for diagnosis. Test changes by running the shipped hook and script tests through the project's test command.
